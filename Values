ChatGPT
Nice — I’ll turn the market’s behavior and recent investor surveys into a ranked list of the **50 values investors around the world have prioritized over the last decade**, ordered from most-valued to least-valued, with a short description for each. My ranking is based on observable price- and allocation-driven behavior in markets plus repeated themes from major investor surveys and industry research (e.g., PwC, PRI and CFA Institute discussions on ESG, private markets, transparency and risk).

Notes & caveats

* These items are ranked by **how much pricing, allocations and investor flows over the last decade** show they mattered — e.g., the explosive growth of passive/low-cost products shows how cost/fee efficiency (7) rose in importance; steady flows into ESG/sustainable funds and demand for audited sustainability data explain the prominence of ESG and assurance (8, 28). ([PwC][1], [UN PRI][2])
* Private markets and liquidity tradeoffs (15, 42) have become big themes as investors chased yield and alpha outside public markets — but those same flows raise concerns about opacity and systemic risk. ([CFA Institute Daily Browse][3])
* Governance and reporting transparency (5, 6, 28) repeatedly show up in large investor surveys as essential for trust and capital allocation. ([PwC][1], [Reuters][4])

If you want, I can:

* Convert this into a spreadsheet (CSV/Excel) with short, medium and long descriptions per value; or
* Re-rank these specifically for retail investors vs large institutional investors (they value some items differently); or
* Produce a short slide deck or one-page visual that groups these values into themes (Return & Risk, Governance & Transparency, Cost & Access, ESG & Impact, Operational Resilience).

"Provide the biggest movers of values over the last 3 years. So which values became more or less valued the most from 2022 to 2025? List 5 of each."
ChatGPT
Here’s what’s shifted the most in terms of investor values from **2022 to 2025**—the top five values that have gained notable importance (“**movers up**”), and the top five that have declined (“**movers down**”), based on investor surveys and market behavior.

---

## Biggest Movers — Gaining in Importance (2022 → 2025)

1. **Resilience / Active Risk Management**
   Investor sentiment has shifted heavily toward building resilience in an unpredictable world. In 2025, Schroders reports that “resilience now tops the investment agenda,” with investors favoring active, specialist, and credit-based strategies to manage complexity and volatility. ([Schroders][1])

2. **Technological Innovation & AI Adoption**
   In the 2023 PwC Global Investor Survey, 59% of respondents see technological change—and particularly faster AI adoption—as “very” or “extremely important” for value creation, highlighting a growing emphasis on technology-driven transformation. ([PwC][2], [PwC][3])

3. **Private Markets & Private Debt / Credit**
   There’s been a marked shift from public equities toward private markets. Schroders shows growing investor interest in private equity (45%) and private debt (44%). ([Schroders][1])
   Privately, family offices are increasing allocations to private equity, direct company stakes, real estate, AI, renewables, and digital assets. ([Barron's][4])

4. **Climate / Sustainability & Risk Management**
   Climate-related risks have risen in investor concern. The 2023 PwC survey ranked climate risks as on par with cyber risk at 32% importance. Though sustainability remains important, mention of it dropped slightly by about 4% compared to the prior year—but it's still in focus. ([PwC][2])

5. **Geographic Diversification & Value-seeking Outside the U.S.**
   There’s clearly been increased interest in global equities beyond U.S. markets. Surveys show investor enthusiasm for European and emerging-market stocks, and an overall lowering of cash holdings to historically low levels. ([The Australian][5]) Investors have also shown continued skepticism over U.S. stock valuations. ([Axios][6], [The Australian][5])

---

## Biggest Movers — Declining in Importance (2022 → 2025)

1. **Overreliance on U.S. Equities**
   The U.S. equity market has lost its appeal. Investor confidence in U.S. stocks weakened significantly—BofA reports a 24-year high in the share of investors who believe U.S. stocks are overvalued. Interest has shifted toward global and value-oriented equities. ([Axios][6], [The Australian][5])

2. **Passive / U.S.-centric Market Dependence**
   The growing skepticism toward U.S. markets, and the pivot to active strategies and private alternatives, suggests a reduced preference for passive, U.S.-focused investing.

3. **Growth-at-expense-of-value Bias**
   Surging value-based strategies: in late 2022, the Russell 1000 Value index delivered one of its strongest months since 1978, overtaking growth stocks. This indicates a renewed investor preference for value over growth. ([CNBC][7])

4. **Cash Hoarding / High Cash Allocation**
   Cash levels are falling sharply. According to BofA, fund managers have cut cash to the lowest levels in 15 years—an indicator that hoarding cash has become less valued. ([The Australian][5])

5. **“Set-and-Forget” / Long Static Allocations**
   Investors are increasingly shifting strategies (68% plan to shift or expand in 2025), rather than sticking with static allocations. ([104.5 WOKV][8], [K99.1FM][9])

| **Down**  | Cash Accumulation                            | Cash allocations are now historically low ([The Australian][5])                                         |
| **Down**  | Static, Long-term Set-and-Forget Allocations | 68% of investors plan to shift strategies in 2025 ([104.5 WOKV][8])                                     |
