-(ChatGPT 9/21/2025) "Rank the top 20 public companies for having the most deep philosophical missions. The philosophy has to be adhered to. The public company can be of any size market cap."
ChatGPT
Ranking companies by the depth of their philosophy *and* how well they seem to live by it is subjective, but I can put together a list of public (or publicly‐reporting) companies that are often cited as having unusually strong, deep missions *and* fairly good track records of sticking to them. If you like, I can also make a tiered: top 5, next 15, etc. Here’s my take on **20** such companies, ordered roughly from strongest mission + adherence downwards. Happy to adjust depending on what you mean by “deep philosophical mission.”

---

## Criteria I used

Before the list, here’s what I considered:

* A mission or purpose that goes beyond profit: some ethical, environmental, social, or philosophical ideal (justice, sustainability, human flourishing, etc.).
* Evidence that the company acts on that mission in meaningful ways (not just PR statements).
* Publicly traded, or at least with public financials or strong public accountability (some are benefit corporations, B-Corps, or subsidiaries of large public companies).
* Consistency: mission lived over time, not just a recent campaign.

## Top 20 Companies with Deep Philosophical Missions & Good Adherence

Here are 20 companies, with notes; ranking not strict but ordered by how “deep + well-adhered” I judge them to be.

If forced to choose a “top 5” from that list purely by philosophical depth + high adherence, I’d pick:

1. **Tesla**
2. **Unilever**
3. **Patagonia**
4. **Google/Alphabet**
5. **Warby Parker**

If you want, I can try to make a more rigorous ranking (scored on certain axes) and include maybe even some you don’t know, plus trade-offs. Do you want me to do that?
