- (ChatGPT 8/8/2025) "Further expand on the idea of how stock prices are the stories people tell themselves about companies. Provide a few examples."
ChatGPT
The idea that **stock prices are the stories people tell themselves about companies** comes from the recognition that markets are not just cold, rational number-crunching machines. Prices emerge from human perception, belief, and collective narrative-making.

A company’s “true” value—based on cash flows, assets, or discounted earnings—matters, but what actually drives *short- and medium-term* prices is the story investors believe **right now** about the company’s future. These stories are shaped by:

* Media coverage and analyst reports
* Cultural mood and macroeconomic context
* Visible success or failure of similar companies
* Personal biases and anecdotes
* A herd mentality where belief is reinforced by seeing others believe

In this sense, the market is a kind of **giant collaborative fiction**, and the “stock price” is the current market consensus of how the story will unfold.

---

### **Examples**

#### **1. Tesla – The Visionary Hero**

**Story:** “Tesla isn’t just a car company; it’s leading the clean-energy revolution, powered by Elon Musk’s genius and relentless innovation.”

* For years, this narrative allowed Tesla to trade at valuations far beyond traditional automakers, even when production volume and profits were small compared to giants like Toyota or GM.
* Investors weren’t just buying a company—they were buying a *plotline* about electric dominance, space travel synergy, and AI-powered self-driving cars.
* When Musk’s reputation took hits or competition intensified, the “story” wavered, and so did the price.

---

#### **2. GameStop – The Underdog Rebellion**

**Story:** “Wall Street hedge funds have shorted this nostalgic video game retailer into oblivion. Ordinary investors can rise up, squeeze them, and make history.”

* In early 2021, GameStop’s fundamentals didn’t change significantly—but the *narrative* caught fire on Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets.
* The price skyrocketed from under \$20 to over \$400 intraday, powered by the *emotional weight* of the David vs. Goliath storyline.
* The price collapse that followed was the story’s natural “third act”—momentum faded, and reality crept back in.

---

#### **3. Apple – The Timeless Innovator**

**Story:** “Apple creates products so beautiful, intuitive, and essential that people will always pay a premium. It’s the most reliable growth stock in the world.”

* Over the last two decades, this narrative has carried Apple through leadership transitions, product saturation fears, and geopolitical tensions.
* Even when product announcements underwhelm analysts, the brand’s *myth* keeps long-term investors loyal, sustaining a high valuation multiple.
* The strength of the story itself becomes a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy—faith leads to capital, which funds innovation, which reinforces faith.

---

#### **4. NVIDIA – The AI Gold Rush Supplier**

**Story:** “NVIDIA is selling the picks and shovels for the AI revolution—every major player needs their chips.”

* The current price surge isn’t just about current revenue; it’s about an imagined future where NVIDIA remains *the* irreplaceable enabler of AI.
* This story makes investors willing to pay forward many years of hypothetical growth today.
* If the AI narrative slows or rivals catch up technologically, the plot could take a twist—and so would the valuation.

---

In short, stock prices aren’t just about numbers on a balance sheet. They are **liquid narratives**—constantly edited, rewritten, and collectively authored by millions of minds in real time.

If you want, I can also map **how these stories shift over time** using real historical price data and sentiment analysis, to show the plot arcs in stock prices like novels. That would make the “stories” even more visible.
