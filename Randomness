If you want, I can:

* Turn this into a **ranked list by growth potential**, or
* Expand any company into a 1-page deep-dive (revenue trends, recent quarterly highlights, valuation metrics), or
* Replace any of these with different random companies in a particular sector (energy, biotech, small-cap, etc.).

"Rank by growth potential."
ChatGPT
Got it — I’ll rank the **15 companies by growth potential** (looking at 5–15 year horizons, balancing addressable market size, execution capacity, and industry trends).

---

## 📈 Growth Potential Ranking

**1. NVIDIA (NVDA)**

* AI/datacenter dominance, expanding into networking, software, automotive AI.
* Tailwinds: generative AI, edge AI, simulation.
* 🚀 Highest structural growth trajectory.

**2. Snowflake (SNOW)**

* Cloud-native data infrastructure + AI data pipelines.
* Strong ARR growth, expanding TAM in data economy.
* Risk: hyperscaler competition.

**3. CrowdStrike (CRWD)**

* Cybersecurity demand is structural; cloud-native model scales well.
* Strong execution and AI features make it a long-term compounder.

**4. Tesla (TSLA)**

* EV market still growing, plus autonomy, robotics, energy storage.
* Execution + regulatory hurdles could swing upside/downside massively.

**5. Shopify (SHOP)**

* E-commerce enablement is sticky; expansion in payments, fulfillment.
* Growth depends on SMB resilience and ability to compete with Amazon ecosystem.

**6. DraftKings (DKNG)**

* Sports betting & online gaming still early in U.S. rollout.
* TAM expansion as more states legalize; profitability path is key risk.

**7. Block (SQ)**

* Strong potential from Cash App ecosystem + merchant payments.
* Optionality with bitcoin exposure + fintech expansion.

**8. Moderna (MRNA)**

* If pipeline succeeds (oncology, RSV, CMV), can reinvent itself post-COVID.
* High upside but very binary clinical/regulatory risks.

**9. Plug Power (PLUG)**

* Green hydrogen and fuel cells have transformative potential.
* But execution and funding challenges make it risky.

**10. Apple (AAPL)**

* Mature, but still large growth engines in services, wearables, AI integration.
* Augmented reality/metaverse headset could expand ecosystem.

**11. Zoom Video (ZM)**

* Growth normalized post-COVID; platform expansion possible but competitive.
* Likely slower CAGR than top-tier SaaS peers.

**12. NextEra Energy (NEE)**

* Strong renewable growth story with stable regulated utility cash flows.
* Less explosive, more steady compounder.

**13. Etsy (ETSY)**

* Niche marketplace with loyal user base; growth moderate but sustainable.

---

👉 This list balances **absolute TAM potential** (NVIDIA, Snowflake, CrowdStrike) with **execution and risk-adjusted reality** (NextEra, Salesforce, Pfizer).

Would you like me to **re-rank them by risk-adjusted growth potential** (i.e., best balance of growth + safety), or keep this as a pure upside ranking?
-(ChatGPT 9/21/2025) "Pick 5 random sets of 3 public companies. Show the return on investment for each of the 5 random sets from 2010 to now. Rank each set by return on investment."
ChatGPT
Nice — I picked 5 random 3-stock sets (all companies were publicly traded at the start of 2010) and computed the return from the start of 2010 (using **Macrotrends’ “Year Open 2010”** as the start price) to the most recent close shown on Macrotrends (**as of September 19, 2025**). I invested \$1 in each company at the 2010 start price, so each set is an equal-weighted 3-stock basket (\$3 total initial). Final values are the sum of those 3 \$1 → current-value multiples. Sources for each company’s start and end prices are shown inline.

Method (short): for each ticker
• start = Macrotrends **Year Open (2010)**; end = Macrotrends **latest closing price (as of Sep 19, 2025)**.
• Per-company multiplier = end / start.
• Set final dollars = sum(multipliers) (that is, \$1 invested in each stock).
• Set ROI = (final\_dollars / 3) − 1 (reported as percent).

## Notes, caveats and transparency

* All start prices used were **Macrotrends “Year Open (2010)”** values; “Year Open” is a reasonable proxy for *start-of-year* price — Macrotrends shows these numbers in the annual tables. (Each company citation above links to the Macrotrends page where the 2010 Year Open and the “latest closing price as of Sep 19, 2025” are displayed.) ([Macrotrends][1])
* “Latest close” values are the Macrotrends page’s most recent close (the pages note **as of September 19, 2025**). If you want the price as of a different date (e.g., Jan 1, 2010 exact trading day or today’s live quote), I can recompute with that exact date.
* These numbers use **price appreciation only** (no dividends reinvested). If you want **total return** (dividends reinvested), the outcomes — especially for dividend payers like XOM, JNJ, KO, IBM, etc. — will be meaningfully higher.
* I used equal \$1 investments per stock to create a simple, comparable metric for each set. If you’d prefer a different weighting (market-cap weighting, dollar-weighted, or invest \$3 in one stock and \$0 in others), tell me and I’ll recompute.
* Sources: Macrotrends pages for each ticker used above (the inline citations point to the exact Macrotrends snapshots that contain both the 2010 Year Open and the latest close figures). ([Macrotrends][1])

---

Want me to:
• show this in a neat table or CSV for download?
• recompute using exact trading-day prices (e.g., Jan 4, 2010 open/close) or with dividends reinvested?
• pick 5 *new* random sets (different seed) and redo the ranking?
