👉 This list balances **absolute TAM potential** (NVIDIA, Snowflake, CrowdStrike) with **execution and risk-adjusted reality** (NextEra, Salesforce, Pfizer).

Would you like me to **re-rank them by risk-adjusted growth potential** (i.e., best balance of growth + safety), or keep this as a pure upside ranking?
-(ChatGPT 9/21/2025) "Pick 5 random sets of 3 public companies. Show the return on investment for each of the 5 random sets from 2010 to now. Rank each set by return on investment."
ChatGPT
Nice — I picked 5 random 3-stock sets (all companies were publicly traded at the start of 2010) and computed the return from the start of 2010 (using **Macrotrends’ “Year Open 2010”** as the start price) to the most recent close shown on Macrotrends (**as of September 19, 2025**). I invested \$1 in each company at the 2010 start price, so each set is an equal-weighted 3-stock basket (\$3 total initial). Final values are the sum of those 3 \$1 → current-value multiples. Sources for each company’s start and end prices are shown inline.

Method (short): for each ticker
• start = Macrotrends **Year Open (2010)**; end = Macrotrends **latest closing price (as of Sep 19, 2025)**.
• Per-company multiplier = end / start.
• Set final dollars = sum(multipliers) (that is, \$1 invested in each stock).
• Set ROI = (final\_dollars / 3) − 1 (reported as percent).

## Notes, caveats and transparency

* All start prices used were **Macrotrends “Year Open (2010)”** values; “Year Open” is a reasonable proxy for *start-of-year* price — Macrotrends shows these numbers in the annual tables. (Each company citation above links to the Macrotrends page where the 2010 Year Open and the “latest closing price as of Sep 19, 2025” are displayed.) ([Macrotrends][1])
* “Latest close” values are the Macrotrends page’s most recent close (the pages note **as of September 19, 2025**). If you want the price as of a different date (e.g., Jan 1, 2010 exact trading day or today’s live quote), I can recompute with that exact date.
* These numbers use **price appreciation only** (no dividends reinvested). If you want **total return** (dividends reinvested), the outcomes — especially for dividend payers like XOM, JNJ, KO, IBM, etc. — will be meaningfully higher.
* I used equal \$1 investments per stock to create a simple, comparable metric for each set. If you’d prefer a different weighting (market-cap weighting, dollar-weighted, or invest \$3 in one stock and \$0 in others), tell me and I’ll recompute.
* Sources: Macrotrends pages for each ticker used above (the inline citations point to the exact Macrotrends snapshots that contain both the 2010 Year Open and the latest close figures). ([Macrotrends][1])

---

Want me to:
• show this in a neat table or CSV for download?
• recompute using exact trading-day prices (e.g., Jan 4, 2010 open/close) or with dividends reinvested?
• pick 5 *new* random sets (different seed) and redo the ranking?

-(Gemini 9/24/2025) "Provide a list of 25 random mid-size public companies along with the outlook of the company, the focus of the company, and what would be an idea that would both expand the company and go along with its current focus. "
Gemini
**Definition of a Mid-Size Public Company**

Mid-size public companies, often referred to as mid-cap companies, generally have a market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion. They are considered to be in a "sweet spot" between the stability of large-cap companies and the higher growth potential (and volatility) of small-cap companies. Mid-cap companies are often established in their industries and are actively pursuing expansion, which makes them an interesting area for investment and strategic analysis.

**25 Random Mid-Size Public Companies and Expansion Ideas**

Here is a list of 25 random mid-size public companies. The outlook and focus are based on general industry trends and the company's established business model. The expansion idea is a speculative concept designed to align with the company's current focus and leverage its strengths for growth.

1.  **Company:** **Toll Brothers (TOL)**
    * **Focus:** Luxury home construction in affluent suburban and urban markets across the United States.
    * **Outlook:** Positive, benefiting from a sustained demand for new housing, particularly in the luxury segment. The company is well-positioned to capitalize on demographic shifts and the desire for more space and modern amenities.
    * **Expansion Idea:** Develop a new division focused on high-end modular or pre-fabricated luxury homes. This would allow them to build high-quality, custom homes more quickly and efficiently, potentially expanding into new geographical markets and attracting a different segment of the luxury market that values speed and efficiency.

2.  **Company:** **HubSpot (HUBS)**
    * **Focus:** Providing a comprehensive cloud-based marketing, sales, and customer service software platform for small and medium-sized businesses.
    * **Outlook:** Strong, driven by the increasing need for integrated digital marketing and customer relationship management (CRM) tools. The company's all-in-one platform is a significant competitive advantage.
    * **Expansion Idea:** Create a specialized AI-powered "Growth Accelerator" service for its customers. This service would use machine learning to analyze a business's data on the HubSpot platform and provide hyper-personalized, automated marketing and sales strategies, essentially acting as a virtual CMO for its clients.

3.  **Company:** **Crocs (CROX)**
    * **Focus:** Designing, manufacturing, and marketing comfortable, casual footwear. The company has successfully shifted from a niche product to a mainstream fashion staple.
    * **Outlook:** Stable, with a strong brand identity and a loyal customer base. The company is focused on product innovation and strategic collaborations to maintain relevance.
    * **Expansion Idea:** Launch a direct-to-consumer "Custom Creator" platform. This would allow customers to design their own unique Crocs, choosing colors, Jibbitz charms, and even adding custom text. This would not only enhance brand engagement and loyalty but also create a new, high-margin product line.

4.  **Company:** **Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)**
    * **Focus:** Developing, manufacturing, and marketing robotic products designed to improve clinical outcomes of surgical procedures. Its flagship product is the da Vinci Surgical System.
    * **Outlook:** Excellent, as the demand for minimally invasive surgery continues to grow. The company is a market leader with a strong intellectual property portfolio.
    * **Expansion Idea:** Partner with major medical research institutions and universities to establish "Intuitive Surgical Innovation Labs." These labs would provide access to their robotic systems for developing and testing new surgical techniques and procedures, solidifying their position as an industry pioneer and creating a pipeline for future applications of their technology.

5.  **Company:** **Marvell Technology (MRVL)**
    * **Focus:** Developing and selling semiconductor and software solutions for data infrastructure, including enterprise, cloud, and carrier networks.
