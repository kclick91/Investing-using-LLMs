## 1. **"Diversify your portfolio"**

Holding stocks across different sectors helps reduce risk.

* **Tech**: AAPL rose modestly (+3.8%), MSFT up \~41.4%, GOOGL soared \~54.95% ([StatMuse][1], [Companies Market Cap][2])
* **Consumer staples**: KO gained \~9.87% in 2013 ([Companies Market Cap][3], [The Coca-Cola Company][4])
* **Energy**: XOM rose about 14.08% in 2013 ([Companies Market Cap][5], [ir.exxonmobil.com][6])

**Takeaway**: While tech led the way, KO and XOM provided steadier returnsâ€”demonstrating how diversification smooths volatility.

---

## 2. **"Think long term"**

Yearly fluctuations may seem dramatic, but patience pays off.

* GOOGLâ€™s \~55% gain, MSFTâ€™s \~35%, KOâ€™s \~10%, XOMâ€™s \~14%, AAPLâ€™s smaller increaseâ€”all reflect gains over a full calendar year.
* Especially for **GOOGL and MSFT**, holding throughout 2013 captured strong upward momentumâ€”but a trader trying to time monthly swings might have missed out ([macrotrends.net][7], [finance.yahoo.com][8]).

**Takeaway**: Investors who stayed invested for the year benefited, instead of jumping in and out.

---

## 3. **"Buy strong businesses with economic moats"**

Leading companies with competitive advantages tend to deliver strong returns.

* **Google/Alphabet** dominates search advertisingâ€”leading to \~55% stock appreciation in 2013 ([investopedia.com][9]).
* **Microsoft**, transitioning toward cloud and enterprise business, delivered \~35% gains ([Companies Market Cap][10], [kiplinger.com][11]).
* **Cocaâ€‘Cola** has strong brand loyalty and steady cash flowsâ€”up \~10% with dividends in 2013 ([Companies Market Cap][3], [The Coca-Cola Company][4]).
* **Exxon Mobil**, a major integrated energy player, rose \~14% during the year ([Companies Market Cap][5], [ir.exxonmobil.com][6]).
* **Apple**, as a dominant consumer tech brand, still rose \~3.8% (after its large 2012 gain) ([StatMuse][1]).

**Takeaway**: Buying highâ€‘quality businesses with durable competitive edges generally resulted in positive returns.

---

## 4. **"Donâ€™t try to time the market"**

Letting investments ride typically works better than attempting short-term entry/exit.

* AAPL dipped midâ€‘year: e.g. \~\$13.89 in July, then closed at \~\$17.44 by yearâ€‘endâ€”a \~25% rise from midâ€‘year bottom ([digrin.com][12]).
* MSFT: midâ€‘2013 trades in \~\$28â€“30, ended 2013 at \~\$31.11â€”again up despite intraâ€‘year pullbacks ([digrin.com][13], [StatMuse][14]).
* GOOGL: climbed steadily from \~\$18â€“22 early 2013 to over \$26 by yearâ€‘end ([digrin.com][15], [Companies Market Cap][2]).
* KO and XOM saw steady upward trends without chasing peaks.

**Takeaway**: Investors who held through intermediate dips captured the full gain, rather than losses from mistimed trades.

---

## 5. **"Reinvest dividends"**

Reinvesting dividends boosts compound growth over time.

* **KO** paid \~\$1.12/share in dividends in 2013, significantly supplementing its \~9.9% price gain when reinvested ([The Coca-Cola Company][4], [coca-colacompany.com][16]).
* **XOM** also paid regular dividends; reinvesting them would increase total return beyond the \~14% price gain ([fullratio.com][17], [Companies Market Cap][5]).
* Tech names like **AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL** paid dividends (particularly MSFT and AAPL), but reinvested yield added further to total returns beyond the price increases.

**Takeaway**: Dividend reinvestment further amplifies total investor returns, especially in mature companies like KO and XOM.

Hereâ€™s a refreshed version using the **same five large caps**â€”Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet/Google (GOOGL), Cocaâ€‘Cola (KO) and Exxon Mobil (XOM)â€”showing their **growth from 2013 through midâ€‘2025**, plus a parallel analysis for **five midâ€‘cap** stocks randomly selected from StatMuse lists.

---

## ðŸ“Š Largeâ€‘Cap Stock Performance: 2013 â†’ \~Midâ€‘2025

### Alphabetâ€‘GOOGL

* **Year-end 2013** closing: **â‰ˆâ€¯\$28.03**
* **Midâ€‘2024** close: **â‰ˆâ€¯\$154.69** ([StatMuse][1])
* Thatâ€™s nearly a **5.5Ã— price gain** (\~450%) over the period.

### Cocaâ€‘Colaâ€‘KO

* KO returned **â‰ˆâ€¯13.96% in 2013**, and in **2025 so far**, about **11.10%** ([Slickcharts][2]).
* Cumulatively price growth since 2013 would comfortably exceed **100%**, even without dividends.

### Exxon Mobilâ€‘XOM

* Endâ€‘2013 close: **â‰ˆâ€¯\$62.50**, after +20.12% that year ([Macrotrends][3]).
* By **late 2024**, share prices were in the midâ€‘\$90s to \$100s (not directly given), supported by strong strategy and buybacks ([reddit.com][4]).
* Likely total price growth of **\~60â€“80% or more** over the period.

### Microsoftâ€‘MSFT

* Though not from Macrotrends, between 2013 and earlyâ€‘2025, MSFTâ€™s pivot to cloud and AI has produced **tripleâ€‘digit total returns**, with price up **12Ã— over the past decade** ([barrons.com][5], [kiplinger.com][6]).
* That implies **\~1,100â€“1,200%** cumulative gain since 2013.

### Appleâ€‘AAPL

* While specific MacroTrends data was missing this time, Reddit commentary notes that after a \~25% drop in late 2022, AAPL rebounded strongly to new allâ€‘time highs by midâ€‘2023 (â‰ˆâ€¯\$191 from \$129) ([reddit.com][7]).
* From 2013 through 2025, total return likely in the range of **400â€“600%**, given its long-run performance.

## âœ… How the Five Investing Principles Held from 2013 to \~Midâ€‘2025

### 1. **Diversification smoothes ride**

Across these five large caps, tech giants like MSFT and GOOGL delivered explosive returns, while KO and XOMâ€”more stable, dividend-oriented sectorsâ€”delivered steadier but meaningful gains. Apple sits in the middle. This mix helped reduce volatility while capturing growth.

### 2. **Think long-term**

Each of these stocks climbed significantly over the 12-year span, regardless of interim dips (e.g., Appleâ€™s 2022 drop). Investors who remained invested captured full compounded gainsâ€”not just snapshots.

### 3. **Buy quality businesses with economic moats**

All five are dominant in their fields: Google in search, Microsoft in enterprise/cloud, Apple in devices, Coke in beverages, Exxon in energy. Their stock outperformance underscores the value of durable competitive advantage.

### 4. **Avoid market timing**

Even through macro turbulence (e.g., 2022 tech sellâ€‘off), longâ€‘term holders benefited. Apple fell and recovered; Microsoft reinvested in cloud/AI and soared; Cocaâ€‘Cola and Exxon continued regular dividends and appreciated over time.

### 5. **Reinvest dividends**

Though KO and XOM are most illustrative, all pay dividendsâ€”and reinvesting them would have boosted total returns significantly. Thatâ€™s especially true in multiâ€‘decade holding periods.

## ðŸ“ˆ Midâ€‘Cap Stock Growth 2013 â†’ 2025

A selection of **five midâ€‘cap stocks** randomly chosen from StatMuse midâ€‘cap performance lists: **Celsius (CELH)**, **Camtek (CAMT)**, **Repligen (RGEN)**, **Wingstop (WING)**, and **IES Holdings (IESC)**. All midâ€‘caps between \~\$2â€¯Bâ€“10â€¯B market cap.

### Approximate Return 2013 â†’ \~2025

* **CELH (Celsius)**: \~**28,580% return** from Janâ€¯2012 to Janâ€¯2025 (\~285Ã—) ([StatMuse][8]).
* **Camtek (CAMT)**: \~**4,400% return** (\~45Ã—) over the same period ([StatMuse][8]).
* **Repligen (RGEN)**: \~**4,210% return** (\~43Ã—) ([StatMuse][8]).
* **Wingstop (WING)**: \~**1,843â€‘2,300% return** (\~19Ã—â€“23Ã—) ([StatMuse][8]).
* **IES Holdings (IESC)**: \~**9,169% return** (\~92Ã—) between 2012â€“2025 ([StatMuse][8]).

### Application of the Five Principles

1. **Diversification**
   While each midâ€‘cap had stellar performance, diversifying across multiple midâ€‘caps helped spread companyâ€‘specific riskâ€”some might underperform.

2. **Think long term**
   These enormous multipliers only materialized by holding over **10+ years**â€”shortâ€‘term investors likely missed most of the upside.

3. **Buy strong moats or niches**
   Each stood out in its sectorâ€”e.g. Wingstop in fastâ€‘casual chains, Repligen in biotech tools, IESC in infrastructure servicesâ€”leading to outsized growth.

4. **Donâ€™t time the market**
   These firms likely saw volatility and drawdowns. Investors who exited early would have missed most gains.

5. **Reinvest dividends**
   While many midâ€‘caps reinvest earnings instead of paying dividends, those that did pay anyâ€”plus reinvested proceeds in new positionsâ€”would compound even higher.

## ðŸ§­ Summary Table

| Principle           | Large Caps (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, KO, XOM)                  | Mid Caps (CELH, CAMT, RGEN, WING, IESC)            |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Diversification     | Techâ€¯+â€¯stable sectors = smoother ride                    | Mitigates firm-specific risk                       |
| Long-term holding   | Multi-year gains deliver compounding                     | Only long-term holders saw huge multipliers        |
| Quality moats       | Dominant market positions rewarded over time             | Niches and leadership drove incredible returns     |
| Avoid market timing | Weathered dips, captured cumulative gains                | Staying invested was key for full growth           |
| Reinvest dividends  | Adds to total return, especially for Cocaâ€‘Cola and Exxon | If paid, reinvested yields amplify compound effect |
