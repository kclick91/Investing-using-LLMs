- (ChatGPT Full Discussion 9/5/2025)"List the 10 most profitable stocks from the year 2014 to 2024 and provide 10 stocks that are most similar to those stocks for the projected period from year 2025 to year 2035."
ChatGPT
Nice — I’ll interpret **“most profitable stocks from the year 2014 to 2024”** as **the 10 U.S. stocks with the largest cumulative total price returns between 2014 and 2024** (i.e., best-performing stocks over that period). That’s a reasonable, commonly-used way to read “most profitable stocks” in a stock-market context. If you meant something else (e.g., companies with highest net income over that period) tell me and I’ll redo it.

Below I list the **top 10** performers (2014→2024) and then give **10 stocks that are most similar** (one suggested peer per top performer) that could be candidates to watch for the *projected* period **2025→2035**, with a short rationale for each pairing. These projection suggestions are **speculative** — forward-looking and not financial advice.

# A — Top 10 best-performing U.S. stocks, 2014 → 2024

# B — Ten stocks *similar to those top 10* (candidates to watch 2025 → 2035)

Below I map each top performer to one stock that is **most similar** by business model / sector / secular growth driver and could plausibly benefit in 2025–2035 for similar reasons. Each pairing has a 1–2 line rationale and a supporting citation.

1. **Top performer → NVIDIA (NVDA)**
   **Suggested similar stock:** **Marvell Technology (MRVL)** — Marvell designs chips and SoCs for data centers, networking and storage (like NVIDIA benefits from data-center/AI tailwinds). If data-center and AI infrastructure spending continues, Marvell is a natural semiconductor peer to watch. ([StockAnalysis][2], [Seeking Alpha][3])

2. **Top performer → Broadcom (AVGO)**
   **Suggested similar stock:** **Qualcomm (QCOM)** — Broadcom and Qualcomm both generate large semiconductor & communications revenues, with exposure to mobile, networking and licensing; Qualcomm is a direct peer for connectivity and communications chips. ([Investopedia][4], [Barchart.com][5])

3. **Top performer → The Trade Desk (TTD)**
   **Suggested similar stock:** **Roku (ROKU)** — Roku operates the leading streaming-platform + ad business and competes in programmatic/TV ad monetization — a logical ad-tech / connected-TV peer to The Trade Desk. The companies also partner/compete in streaming ad ecosystems. ([Roku][6], [Roku][7])

4. **Top performer → Tesla (TSLA)**
   **Suggested similar stock:** **BYD (BYD / BYDDF)** — BYD is a major vertically integrated EV maker (China/global) with battery tech and large global EV volumes — a natural EV-sector peer for long-term 2025–2035 EV adoption trends. (Note: BYD is headquartered in China — ticker/market differ.) ([Wikipedia][8], [Reuters][9])

5. **Top performer → Texas Pacific Land Trust (TPL)**
   **Suggested similar stock:** **Diamondback Energy (FANG)** — TPL benefited from land/royalty exposure in Texas and energy-related cash flows; Diamondback is a Permian-focused operator that also benefits from Permian acreage/production economics — a more operator-focused way to play Permian/land-value energy tailwinds. ([StatMuse][1], [Yahoo Finance][10])

6. **Top performer → Axon Enterprise (AXON)**
   **Suggested similar stock:** **Motorola Solutions (MSI)** — Motorola Solutions supplies public-safety communications, bodycams and related systems — a direct competitor/peer to Axon in public-safety hardware and software. ([Barchart.com][11])

7. **Top performer → Arista Networks (ANET)**
   **Suggested similar stock:** **Cisco Systems (CSCO)** — Arista is a high-growth, cloud/data-center networking specialist; Cisco is the much larger, diversified networking leader — both play the networking & infrastructure theme for cloud/data-center buildouts. ([Nasdaq][12])

8. **Top performer → Fair Isaac (FICO)**
   **Suggested similar stock:** **Equifax (EFX)** — FICO is best known for credit-scoring software and analytics; Equifax is a major consumer-credit data & analytics business — both monetize credit data/analytics and could benefit from continued demand for data-driven decisioning. ([Equifax][13], [StatMuse][1])

9. **Top performer → Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)**
   **Suggested similar stock:** **Intel (INTC)** — AMD and Intel are the two large x86 and data-center CPU/accelerator competitors; Intel is a direct semiconductor peer and would benefit from secular trends in data centers, AI accelerators and compute demand 2025–2035. ([StatMuse][1], [Yahoo Finance][14])

10. **Top performer → Fortinet (FTNT)**
    **Suggested similar stock:** **CrowdStrike (CRWD)** — Fortinet is a network/security appliance and software vendor; CrowdStrike is a cloud-native endpoint and cybersecurity platform — both are core cybersecurity plays that could benefit from growing enterprise security spending. ([StatMuse][1], [Nasdaq][12])

## Short notes, assumptions and caveats

* **Interpretation:** I treated “most profitable” as **best stock performance (price total return) 2014→2024**. If you instead meant **highest corporate net income/profits** over that period, I can re-run with that definition.
* **Projection (2025→2035) logic:** The 10 “similar” picks are chosen by **sector / product overlap / secular growth thesis** (e.g., chipmakers → other chipmakers participating in AI/data-center trends; ad-tech → other programmatic/streaming ad platforms; EV leader → other major EV manufacturers; cybersecurity → other cloud-native security platforms). These are **not** guaranteed winners — they’re meant as plausible peers to watch if the same secular drivers continue. Each pairing includes a supporting source. ([StatMuse][1], [Seeking Alpha][3])
* **Not financial advice:** This is informational and speculative. If you want, I can (a) convert these into a one-page CSV or spreadsheet with tickers, sector, 2014–2024 returns (where available), and links; (b) expand the watchlist to 3–5 similar picks per top stock; or (c) re-run with a different definition (e.g., highest net income, or best risk-adjusted returns). Tell me which and I’ll produce it now.

"If there was one stock that has the most similarity with all 10 high performing companies from 2014 to 2024 and not on the second list, what would be that one company? Provide an explanation."
ChatGPT
Great question — you’re asking:

> *If we step back and look at the **common threads** across all 10 of the best performers from 2014–2024, and then pick **one company not already on the “similar list”** that embodies those themes, which company would it be?*

---

### The choice: **Palantir Technologies (PLTR)**

---

### Why Palantir lines up with all 10 high performers:

1. **AI & Semiconductors (NVIDIA, Broadcom, AMD, Arista)**
   Palantir doesn’t make chips, but its growth depends on the **explosion of compute power** and cloud infrastructure. As AI hardware adoption rises, Palantir provides the **analytics + deployment layer** that puts semiconductors to work for enterprises and governments.

2. **Ad-tech / Software Platforms (The Trade Desk, Fair Isaac)**
   Like TTD and FICO, Palantir monetizes **data platforms and analytics**. Its value proposition is building recurring software ecosystems that organizations can’t easily switch away from — a hallmark of sticky SaaS businesses.

3. **EV & Energy Transitions (Tesla, TPL)**
   Palantir provides **operational optimization** for industries like energy, utilities, and manufacturing. It’s positioning itself as a software backbone for **supply chain, defense, and energy transition projects**, echoing Tesla’s and TPL’s link to macro shifts in energy.

4. **Security & Public Safety (Axon, Fortinet)**
   Palantir’s strongest foothold historically is in **government, defense, and intelligence applications**. Like Axon and Fortinet, it thrives on the megatrend of **security, data protection, and real-time decision-making**.

5. **Crossover with all 10**
   If you abstract what drove the 2014–2024 stars — **AI + cloud infrastructure, data-driven decisioning, transformative hardware/software platforms, exposure to megatrends like EVs/energy/security** — Palantir overlaps **at least partially with every one of them**.

---

### Why not already on the second list?

I avoided Palantir earlier because I was matching **stock-for-stock peers** (chipmaker-to-chipmaker, EV-to-EV, etc.). Palantir doesn’t map 1:1 to any single company but instead sits at the **intersection of their themes**, which is why it emerges as a candidate when you ask for *one stock most similar to all of them combined*.

---

✅ **Summary:**
**Palantir (PLTR)** is the one company not on the peer list that resonates with the **collective DNA** of the 2014–2024 top performers. It bridges **AI, big data, government/enterprise security, infrastructure, and energy transformation** — the same growth drivers that propelled those 10 winners.

---

Would you like me to **quantify this overlap** (e.g., a chart showing which of the 10 themes Palantir touches and to what degree) so you can visually see the “similarity map”?
User
"Provide the second and third as well."
ChatGPT
Perfect — let’s extend the reasoning.

We’re now looking for a **#2 and #3 pick** after Palantir (PLTR), i.e. companies **not in the original peer list** but that share the most overlap with the **10 top performers of 2014–2024**.

---

## #1 — **Palantir (PLTR)**

*(already explained)*

* **Core reason:** Bridges AI, data, defense, and enterprise software — touches nearly all the megatrends of the 2014–2024 winners.

---

## #2 — **Snowflake (SNOW)**

### Why:

* **AI & Semiconductors (NVDA, AMD, AVGO, ANET):** Snowflake is a cloud-native data platform that scales with data-center and compute growth. It doesn’t build chips, but its business **thrives on the rising demand for data processing and AI training pipelines**.
* **Data & Analytics (FICO, TTD):** Like FICO and TTD, Snowflake builds recurring value from **data aggregation, analytics, and monetization ecosystems**.
* **Security & Infrastructure (FTNT, Axon):** A growing focus on **data governance and compliance** overlaps with enterprise security themes.
* **Energy/EV (TSLA, TPL):** Not direct exposure, but Snowflake provides the **infrastructure for those industries to manage massive data flows** (IoT from EVs, geospatial energy data).

✅ **Positioning:** Snowflake is the **purest enterprise-data-scale play** — echoing how multiple top performers were fundamentally data/decision companies.

---

## #3 — **ServiceNow (NOW)**

### Why:

* **AI & Automation (NVDA, AMD, Broadcom):** ServiceNow leverages AI/automation in its **workflow automation platform**, which scales alongside enterprise AI adoption.
* **Ad-tech / SaaS parallels (TTD, FICO):** Like The Trade Desk or FICO, ServiceNow locks customers into **mission-critical software ecosystems** with recurring revenue.
* **Security / Public Safety (FTNT, Axon):** Strong expansion into **IT service management + cybersecurity workflows**, aligning with security-driven growth.
* **Energy/EV tie (TSLA, TPL):** ServiceNow is increasingly used in **operations, compliance, and ESG tracking** — essential for global EV/energy players.

✅ **Positioning:** ServiceNow is a **broad enterprise operating system** for digital workflows, echoing the **platform stickiness** of the biggest 2014–2024 winners.

---

## 🥇🥈🥉 Final trio:

1. **Palantir (PLTR)** → Government/enterprise AI + security + energy + data.
2. **Snowflake (SNOW)** → Cloud-native data infrastructure at the center of AI + analytics.
3. **ServiceNow (NOW)** → Enterprise automation platform with strong AI/security/workflow adoption.

These three are **not one-for-one peers** to the original 10, but they sit at the **intersection of the same megatrends**:

* AI/compute scale
* Data monetization
* Security/defense
* Workflow/platform stickiness
* Exposure to transformative industries (energy, EVs, public safety)

---

Would you like me to **map these three vs. the 10 high performers** in a table (showing how many themes each overlaps) so you can see why Palantir > Snowflake > ServiceNow in “similarity strength”?
