### 🔍 Notes & Methodology

1. **Sources & Rankings**:

   * The rankings are based on the most recent listings (July–August 2025), notably from Times of India and FinanceCharts, which place Apple, NVIDIA, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Tesla, followed by Berkshire Hathaway, Broadcom, and Eli Lilly in the top ten ([BullionVault][2], [The Times of India][3], [Wikipedia][4]).

2. **Gold Price**:

   * Spot gold is currently trading around **\$3,380 USD per troy ounce**, as reported today (August 5, 2025) ([Reuters][5]).

3. **Conversion**:

   * Converted by dividing each company’s market cap in billions by the gold price per ounce.
   * For example, Apple: \$3,419 B ÷ \$3,380 ≈ **1,012 million troy ounces** of gold.

4. **Estimates for 8–10**:

   * For Berkshire Hathaway, Broadcom, and Eli Lilly, precise up‑to‑the‑day market caps weren’t directly listed in the sources, so I used estimates based on typical placement within the top 10 in early 2025, as indicated by Reuters and Investopedia coverage ([Tom's Hardware][6], [The Times of India][3]).

### ✅ Summary

These valuations translate to astonishing gold-equivalent holdings:

* **Apple** alone is worth over **1 billion troy ounces** of gold.
* **NVIDIA** and **Microsoft** each come in close behind with about **970 million** and **907 million ounces**, respectively.

* A date‑specific snapshot (e.g. "as of today at closing"),
* A different price basis (e.g. per gram or per kilogram),
* Or conversion into metric tonnes of gold — just let me know!
