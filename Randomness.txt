If you want, I can:

* Turn this into a **ranked list by growth potential**, or
* Expand any company into a 1-page deep-dive (revenue trends, recent quarterly highlights, valuation metrics), or
* Replace any of these with different random companies in a particular sector (energy, biotech, small-cap, etc.).

"Rank by growth potential."
ChatGPT
Got it — I’ll rank the **15 companies by growth potential** (looking at 5–15 year horizons, balancing addressable market size, execution capacity, and industry trends).

👉 This list balances **absolute TAM potential** (NVIDIA, Snowflake, CrowdStrike) with **execution and risk-adjusted reality** (NextEra, Salesforce, Pfizer).

Would you like me to **re-rank them by risk-adjusted growth potential** (i.e., best balance of growth + safety), or keep this as a pure upside ranking?
