I'll search for recent information about how AI has impacted public company stock prices to provide you with current data.Let me search for more specific information about AI stock performance and losses.Based on the search results and my knowledge of AI's impact on stock markets, I can provide you with a comprehensive ranking of companies that have been most and least benefited by AI developments. Here's the breakdown:

## TOP 10 AI BENEFICIARIES (Stock Price Winners)

1. **Palantir Technologies (PLTR)**
   Gained more than 340% as the company's AI-powered data analytics platforms became essential for government and enterprise clients seeking advanced intelligence capabilities.

2. **Vistra Corp (VST)**
   Rose almost 260% as a power producer serving data centers, benefiting massively from the enormous energy demands of AI computing infrastructure.

3. **NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)**
   Gained more than 170% as the dominant supplier of AI chips and GPUs that power large language models and deep learning systems, capturing the lion's share of AI hardware demand.

4. **Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)**
   Benefited enormously from its early investment in OpenAI and integration of AI across its entire product suite, including Azure cloud services, Office 365, and Copilot AI assistant, driving significant revenue growth and market share gains.

5. **Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL)**
   Collective spending by Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta on AI-related infrastructure could reach $344 billion in 2025, with Google's search dominance enhanced by AI integration and its cloud computing business growing rapidly.

6. **Meta Platforms (META)**
   Transformed its business model around AI, with massive investments in AI research, content recommendation algorithms, and the metaverse, while reducing costs through AI-driven operational efficiency.

7. **Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)**
   AWS became a major AI cloud platform provider, while AI enhanced everything from logistics optimization to Alexa voice services and recommendation engines, driving significant operational improvements.

8. **Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM)**
   As the manufacturer of advanced chips for AI applications, TSM benefited from unprecedented demand for cutting-edge semiconductor fabrication from all major AI companies.

9. **Advanced Semiconductor Engineering (ASE)**
   Profited from the massive demand for chip packaging and testing services as AI chip production scaled globally.

10. **Broadcom Inc. (AVGO)**
    Benefited from providing essential networking and connectivity chips for AI data centers and infrastructure, capturing significant market share in the AI hardware ecosystem.

## TOP 10 AI CASUALTIES (Stock Price Losers)

1. **Intel Corporation (INTC)**
   Despite being a semiconductor giant, Intel missed the AI chip revolution, losing massive market share to NVIDIA and struggling to compete in AI-specific processors, leading to significant stock underperformance.

2. **IBM Corporation (IBM)**
   While investing heavily in AI through Watson, IBM failed to monetize AI effectively, with traditional enterprise services declining faster than AI revenue could compensate, resulting in continued stock stagnation.

3. **Adobe Inc. (ADBE)**
   Adobe is among 2025's worst performers, with shares down about 31% as AI-powered content creation tools disrupted its creative software monopoly, threatening subscription revenue.

4. **Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)**
   Shares of Advanced Micro Devices are down about 43% from the high they reached in early 2024 despite AI investments, as they struggled to compete effectively with NVIDIA in the AI chip market.

5. **Salesforce.com (CRM)**
   While adding AI features, Salesforce faced pressure as AI threatens to automate many CRM functions, and investors questioned whether AI integration justified the company's high valuation multiples.

6. **Oracle Corporation (ORCL)**
   Traditional database business came under pressure from AI-native cloud solutions, and despite cloud investments, Oracle struggled to capture significant AI workload market share against hyperscale competitors.

7. **Cisco Systems (CSCO)**
   Traditional networking hardware became less relevant as cloud-native AI infrastructure dominated, with software-defined networking reducing demand for Cisco's legacy products.

8. **ServiceNow (NOW)**
   Despite AI integrations, faced competitive pressure as AI automation threatened to replace many IT service management functions that ServiceNow traditionally provided.

9. **Snowflake Inc. (SNOW)**
   While positioning as an AI-ready data platform, faced intense competition from major cloud providers' AI services and struggled with customer acquisition costs as AI democratized data analytics.

10. **C3.ai Inc. (AI)**
   C3 still generates about 30% of its revenue from a joint venture with Baker Hughes that is set to expire in fiscal 2025, and if C3 doesn't renew that deal, its revenue will drop off a cliff. Despite its AI focus, the company faced execution challenges and intense competition from larger tech companies offering similar AI platforms.

The AI revolution has created a clear divide between companies that successfully adapted to or enabled AI transformation versus those that were disrupted by it or failed to capture meaningful AI market share. The AI boom has generated clear winners and losers, reshaped industries, and sparked new investment trends, with the impact likely to continue evolving as AI applications expand across all sectors of the economy.
