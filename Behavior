## For each megaâ€‘cap, here are **two comparably behaving but much smaller peers or analogues**:

### 1. **Nvidia (NVDA)**

**Smaller peers:**
â€“ **AMD (Advanced Micro Devices)** â€“ market cap around \$277â€¯billion (â‰ˆâ€¯8% of NVDAâ€™s) and a direct competitor in GPUs and dataâ€‘centre chips ([Business Insider][2]).
â€“ **ACM Research (ACMR)** â€“ a semiconductor equipment company serving wafer cleaning & packaging; much smaller with strong growth potential tied to chip investment trends ([Nasdaq][3]).

### 2. **Microsoft (MSFT)**

**Smaller peers:**
â€“ **Superâ€¯Micro Computer (SMCI)** â€“ smaller tech hardware provider with heavy exposure to AI/data center servers; growing faster than Apple peers ([Nasdaq][4]).
â€“ **Pure Storage (PSTG)** or **NetApp (NTAP)** â€“ storage hardware firms with much lower market cap yet benefiting from enterprise / cloud demand ([Nasdaq][5]).

### 3. **Apple (AAPL)**

**Smaller peers:**
â€“ **Micron Technology (MU)** â€“ memory & storage chip firm; lower valuation and more volatile but behaves similarly to hardware supply in tech cycles ([cashsmarter.financhill.com][6]).
â€“ **NetApp (NTAP)** or **Superâ€¯Micro Computer (SMCI)** again â€“ involved in hardware infrastructure, growing faster though much smaller than Apple ([Nasdaq][5]).

### 4. **Amazon (AMZN)**

**Smaller peers:**
â€“ **Shopify (SHOP)** â€“ eâ€‘commerce software platform; market cap â‰ˆâ€¯\$100â€“140â€¯billion (â‰ˆâ€¯5â€“6% of Amazon), shares some growth drivers in online retail & platform monetization ([fool.com][7], [andomoney.com][8]).
â€“ **MercadoLibre (MELI)** â€“ Latin American eâ€‘commerce & fintech platform; much smaller (\~\$77â€“93â€¯billion) but strong growth and rising share like Amazon in its region ([investors.com][9]).

### 5. **Alphabet (GOOGL)**

**Smaller peers:**
â€“ **Coupang (CPNG)** or **JD.com (JD)** â€“ though in ecommerce they also operate cloud & ads in their regions, smaller caps and regional digital giants ([fool.com][7]).
â€“ **Sea Limited (SE)** â€“ Southeast Asian tech conglomerate with eâ€‘commerce, gaming and fintech exposure; much smaller cap but some overlapping business model with Googleâ€™s diversifications ([andomoney.com][8]).

### 6. **Meta Platforms (META)**

**Smaller peers:**
â€“ **Snap Inc. (SNAP)** â€“ social media and ad revenue exposure; significantly smaller but similar advertising cyclicality. *(Reddit users frequently cite TMNT but not in search.)*
â€“ **Pinterest (PINS)** â€“ another adâ€‘supported social platform with lower cap but comparable adâ€‘tech revenue sensitivity.

### 7. **Saudi Aramco**

**Smaller peers:**
â€“ **Chevron (CVX)** or **ExxonMobil (XOM)** â€“ each with ~~\$500â€“800â€¯billion market caps, still smaller than Aramco (~~\$1.6â€¯T) but similar oil & gas fundamentals ([Wikipedia][10]).

### 8. **Broadcom (AVGO)**

**Smaller peers:**
â€“ **Analog Devices (ADI)** â€“ semiconductor firm with market cap \~â€¯\$115â€¯billion; similar sector performance though elevated margins at Broadcom ([Business Insider][11], [Wikipedia][12]).
â€“ **Texas Instruments (TXN)** â€“ diversified analog and embedded semis; smaller cap but similar cyclicality.

### 9. **TSMC (TSM)**

**Smaller peers:**
â€“ **ACM Research (ACMR)** again, as semiconductor-equipment supplier dependent on TSMCâ€™s customers ([Nasdaq][3]).
â€“ **SMIC** in China / **Enflame** or **Iluvatar CoreX** â€“ smaller AI chip firms compared to TSMCâ€™s foundry model, with much lower valuations though connected to AI hardware demand ([Wikipedia][13]).

### 10. **Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)**

**Smaller peers:**
â€“ **Charles Schwab (SCHW)** â€“ a major US financial services firm with \~â€¯\$130â€‘140â€¯billion cap; a banking/investment analogue, though focused narrower than Berkshireâ€™s conglomerate structure ([Business Insider][11], [Wikipedia][12]).
â€“ **JPMorgan Chase (JPM)** â€“ \~\$730â€¯billion cap; still smaller than BRK but a core financial company with insurance, banking and investment overlaps ([investing.com][14], [Wikipedia][12]).
