- (ChatGPT 8/6/2025) "List the top 10 companies that have a stock price less than $15 that have the strongest economic moats."

Here’s what I could reliably assemble based on current data (as of **August 6, 2025**) and Morningstar moat ratings:

## 🔍 Companies trading **under \$15** per share with a **narrow Morningstar economic moat**

I wasn't able to find 10 such companies with confirmed moat ratings and share prices under \$15—most moat-rated stocks trade above that level—but here are a few that meet the criteria:

### 1. **Hanesbrands Inc. (HBI)**

* **Price**: \~\$4.20
* **Moat rating**: Narrow moat (\~Retail brand strength) ([Morningstar][1])

### 2. **VF Corporation (VFC)**

* **Price**: \~\$12.40
* **Moat rating**: Narrow moat (brands like The North Face, Vans) ([Morningstar][1])

---

## 🧾 What about other moat-rated stocks?

### **Pfizer (PFE)**

* **Moat rating**: Wide moat (drug patents, regulatory barriers) – included in a 2025 wide‑moat list ([Reddit][2])
* **Current price**: \~\$24—**above** the \$15 threshold&#x20;

---

## 📌 Summary & context

* Nearly all **wide-moat stocks** identified in recent Morningstar or Reddit‑compiled lists (e.g. Pfizer, Estee Lauder, Huntington Ingalls, etc.) are trading well **above \$15** per share. ([Reddit][2], [Morningstar][3])
* Among companies trading **below \$15**, only a handful (like Hanesbrands and VF Corp) have public **moat assessments**—though only narrow moat.
* Major wide‑moat names are generally large-cap with share prices significantly over \$15.

---

## 🧠 Why the scarcity?

* Companies with **strong economic moats** (wide moat) tend to be **established, high‑barrier businesses**—leading to larger valuations and share prices often above \$15.
* Lower‑price stocks are typically either smaller firms (often un‑rated) or commodity/ex‑cyclical names that **don’t qualify** for Morningstar moat ratings.

## ✅ Actionable takeaways

If you're strictly targeting stocks **under \$15 with durable competitive advantages**, your options are very limited. Currently, the only ones with documented moat ratings are:

1. **Hanesbrands (HBI)** — narrow moat, price ≈ \$4
2. **VF Corporation (VFC)** — narrow moat, price ≈ \$12

If you're open to **wide-moat companies trading above \$15**, there are more compelling choices, but they fall outside your price boundary.

Would you like help identifying **narrow-moat or underrated value names under \$15 beyond those two**, using broader fundamental criteria? Or are you open to slightly expanding the price range to include some wide‑moat possibilities?
