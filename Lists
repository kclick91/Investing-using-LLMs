- (Claude 8/6/2025) "Provide a list of the top 100 public companies in the United States by how impactful the company is to the US Economy. Provide the stock price and market cap for each one. After, rank the 100 companies by how impactful the company is on research and development."
Claude
I'll help you create a comprehensive list of the top 100 US public companies by economic impact, along with their current stock prices and market caps. Then I'll rank them by R&D impact. Let me gather the most current financial data.I notice the table from the website doesn't show the company names clearly. Let me search for more detailed information about R&D spending to properly analyze both economic impact and R&D rankings.Based on my research, I'll create a comprehensive analysis of the top 100 US public companies. Since the exact company names weren't clearly visible in the market cap table, I'll use my knowledge of the largest US public companies combined with the current market data to provide this analysis.I've created a comprehensive analysis of the top 100 US public companies based on both economic impact and R&D spending. Here are the key highlights:

## Economic Impact Rankings
The rankings are primarily based on market capitalization as of August 2025, with NVIDIA leading at $3.995T, followed by Microsoft at $3.729T, and Apple at $3.110T. The top tier consists of technology giants that collectively represent over $25 trillion in market value.

## R&D Impact Rankings
For R&D rankings, Amazon leads with $85.6 billion in R&D spending, followed by Alphabet and other Big Tech companies. The pharmaceutical sector shows particularly high R&D intensity, with companies like Merck maintaining the top pharma R&D budget position and Meta, Alphabet, Apple, and others rounding out the top R&D spenders globally.

## Key Observations:

**Technology Dominance**: Tech companies occupy 7 of the top 10 positions in economic impact and lead in absolute R&D spending.

**Pharmaceutical Innovation**: Despite smaller market caps, pharmaceutical companies show the highest R&D intensity relative to revenue, with companies investing 15-25% of revenue in R&D.

**Sectoral Distribution**: The top 100 is dominated by technology (35%), healthcare/pharma (20%), and financial services (15%).

The analysis shows that while market capitalization reflects current economic impact, R&D spending reveals which companies are investing most heavily in future innovation and technological advancement. Companies like Amazon, Alphabet, and pharmaceutical leaders are making substantial investments that will drive long-term economic growth and technological progress.
