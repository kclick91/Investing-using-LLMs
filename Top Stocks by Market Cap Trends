### 📉 Year‑end closing stock prices (adjusted)

I gathered year‑end closing prices for the last 10 calendar years (2015–2025) for these five tickers from publicly available historical data (e.g. Macrotrends, Yahoo Finance, CompaniesMarketCap). Prices are approximate year‑end adjusted close.([companiesmarketcap.com][7])

### ℹ️ Notes & limitations

* Data for **year‑end 2025** is partial (only mid‑year values).
* **Older years (2015–2017 for NVDA, AMZN, GOOGL)** are rough estimates from public charts and not exact adjusted closes.
* **Stock splits**, dividends and corporate actions mean actual returns and adjusted close values may differ across sources.
* Market caps and rankings are based on most recent public data (*mid‑2025*), not exactly December 2025.

---

### ✅ If you’d like:

* I can refine this with more precise year‑end adjusted close data via a financial database.
* Provide rendered charts or CSV exports.
* Expand coverage to include others (e.g. Meta, Tesla, Broadcom).

### 📝 Notes & Sources

* **Apple (AAPL)** annual data and closing values are taken from Macrotrends, covering 2020 to 2025 percentage changes and level data for prior years ([macrotrends.net][3]).
* **Alphabet (GOOGL)** data is drawn from Macrotrends, which provides annual closing stock prices from 2020 to 2025, with earlier values estimated from its trends ([macrotrends.net][4]).
* **Microsoft (MSFT)** closing prices largely based on Macrotrends and other historical pricing sources ([macrotrends.net][5]).
* **Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)** year‑end estimates come from Macrotrends data and public IPO-adjusted history ([macrotrends.net][6]).
* **Exxon Mobil (XOM)** closing values are approximate midpoint year‑end prices from Macrotrends and publicly reported highs from late‑2024 ([macrotrends.net][7]).

⚠️ **Limitations**:

* Some values, especially from 2015–2019, are approximations derived from smoothing data sources like Macrotrends, publicly listed ranges, or financial archives.
* BRK.B and GOOGL volatility, stock splits, and class‑share differences (A vs. C shares) may affect direct comparability.
* Exxon’s price in 2020 reflects the oil-price collapse due to pandemic conditions, hence its sharp drop.

---

### ✅ Want More Precision?

If you’d like:

* **Exact adjusted‑closing year‑end prices** from official regulators or data services (e.g. SEC filings, Nasdaq, Yahoo Finance CSV),
* A **chart or CSV export**,
* Or to **expand the list** (e.g. include Meta, Amazon, Tesla),

just let me know and I can pull those official year‑end figures for each year more accurately!

"Using all the information from the previous two prompts, predict the average and sum of the top 5 companies by market cap in the year 2035 with explanation of how that was determined."
ChatGPT
To predict the **sum** and **average** of the stock prices of the **top 5 companies by market cap in 2035**, we’ll build a projection based on:

---

## 🔁 **1. Historical Trends: Data Summary (2015–2024)**

| Year | Sum (Top 5 of 2015) | Avg     | Sum (Top 5 of 2025) | Avg       |
| ---- | ------------------- | ------- | ------------------- | --------- |
| 2015 | \~\$813             | \~\$163 | \~\$1,385           | \~\$277   |
| 2020 | \~\$719             | \~\$144 | \~\$5,058           | \~\$1,012 |
| 2024 | \~\$1,422           | \~\$285 | \~\$6,498           | \~\$1,300 |

* From **2015 to 2024**, the **sum of the 2025-top-5 stock prices** increased nearly **5×**.
* The **2015-top-5 group** rose only **\~75%** in sum during the same period.

So, companies like **NVIDIA, Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft** outperformed legacy giants like **Berkshire Hathaway and Exxon** by a wide margin.

---

## 🧠 **2. Key Assumptions for 2035 Projection**

1. **Tech dominance continues**, though some shuffling among the top 5 is expected.
2. We assume the top 5 in 2035 will be drawn mostly from today's top 10, possibly with newcomers like **Tesla, Meta, Broadcom, or emerging AI/biotech giants**.
3. We expect **average stock price growth of \~9%–12% CAGR** based on historical performance and tech trends.
4. Stock splits and macro events may dampen direct price comparisons but we’ll use adjusted growth for consistency.

---

## 📈 **3. CAGR Estimation (Top 5 of 2025)**

From 2015 → 2024 (9 years), sum grew from \~\$1,385 to \~\$6,498

$$
\text{CAGR} = \left(\frac{6498}{1385}\right)^{1/9} - 1 \approx 18.5\%
$$

We’ll use **a conservative 12% CAGR** for the next 11 years (2024–2035) for the **sum** of stock prices.

---

## 🔮 **4. 2035 Projection for 2025 Top 5 Stocks**

$$
\text{Projected Sum}_{2035} = 6498 \times (1.12)^{11} \approx 6498 \times 3.47 \approx \mathbf{\$22,549}
$$

$$
\text{Projected Average}_{2035} = \frac{22,549}{5} \approx \mathbf{\$4,510}
$$

---

## 🧾 **Final Table: Summary Projection**

| Year            | Sum of Top 5 | Average     |
| --------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| 2015            | \$1,385      | \$277       |
| 2020            | \$5,058      | \$1,012     |
| 2024            | \$6,498      | \$1,300     |
| **2035 (est.)** | **\$22,549** | **\$4,510** |

---

## 🧭 **Rationale Recap**

* Uses 2025 top 5: **NVIDIA, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet**
* 12% CAGR assumed (vs actual \~18.5% historical)
* Does not adjust for dilution, buybacks, or splits — modeled purely on per-share price growth
* Conservative to moderate growth rate chosen given potential regulation, market saturation, and macroeconomic constraints
